Android-App for the Project "Deutschlands-Bahnhoefe"

The App loads Data from a json - file, which contains all railway-stations without a photo in the project. The Json-File will
be created through the java-application from [Peter Storch](https://github.com/pstorch) on https://github.com/pstorch/bahnhoefe.gpx.

The project - website you will find on http://www.deutschlands-bahnhoefe.org and http://www.deutschlands-bahnhoefe.de.


To build the App you need a Google-Maps-Api-Key. Its located under `app/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api.xml`.
