Android-App for the Project "Deutschlands-Bahnhoefe"

The App loads Data from a json - file, which contains all railway-stations without a photo in the project. The Json-File will 
be created through the java-application from Peter Storch on https://github.com/pstorch/bahnhoefe.gpx.

The project - website you will find on http://www.deutschlands-bahnhoefe.org and http://www.deutschlands-bahnhoefe.de.

To build the App you need a Google-Maps-Api-Key. Its place is under res/google_maps_api.xml.
